			<h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
			<h4>Crypto Trader!</h4>
			<p>I'm crypto trader, with over seven years of Experience.
				I've studied the online trading market to a point of
				94% accurate prediction,calculation and efficiency.
				Crypto markets are known for their high volatility.
				Prices can fluctuate dramatically within a short period,
				presenting both opportunities and risks. While volatility
				can lead to significant gains, it can also result in
				substantial losses if not managed carefully.
				But,i've been able to conduct multiple researches
				that have proven that in trading, there are only
				calculated losses.Its just a matter of HardWork
				But like my Father would always say;
				"Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard."
            Before i became a very Good online trader, i was a youth like everyone else,
        but even while being jobless,<br><b>I wasn't lazy!</b></p>
        <p>Laziness is a killer. <br>So i started making researches and i stumbled on 
        being a <b> Procurement Agent.</b> Starting it wasn't easy seeing i didn't have enough capital.
    But never-the-less i started with what i had,and presently i cant think of a better procurement agent 
than Myself</p>
